# Employees Productivity Prediction using Random Forest Classifier
This [Dataquest guided project](https://app.dataquest.io/c/140/m/755/guided-project%3A-predicting-employee-productivity-using-tree-models/1/introduction) uses a dataset from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/597/productivity+prediction+of+garment+employees) to practise the application of Random Forest Classifier. Although it is a guided project from Dataquest, approach and methods for reaching the objective, predicting the productivity of employees, could be entirely unique.
